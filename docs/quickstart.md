# Quickstart

## Setup

The API should nearly work out of the box. You will need to install poetry dependencies, as well as set up a `.env` file at the top level. Once you have a `.env` set up, running `bin/run.sh` should boot up an API you can access in your browser by going to `localhost:8000`, assuming you use the default ports.

## Configuration

The configuration is done via a `.env` file. More information about accepted configurations can be found in `gen3analysis/config.py`.
